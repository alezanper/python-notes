## REST Principles ##
#####################
- A rest api is a way of thinking about how a web server responds to your request
- It does not respond with just data, it responds with resources
- Resources are similar to object-oriented programming
- Think of the server as having resources, and each is able to interact with the pertinent request
- key feature is that REST is supposed to be stateless, this means one request cannot depend on any other requests
- The server only knows about the current request, and not any previous requests
- The application must send enough data to identify the user in every request, or else the server won't associate the request with the user


virtual environment
esentialy gives us a clean python installation (no libraries)
pip freeze  #current libraries
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv --python=python3.8
source venv/bin/activate    # for mac and linux
./venv/Scripts/activate.bat # for windows
pip install Flask-RESTful

jsonify is not necessary with flask restful

pip install Flask-JWT   # json web token
