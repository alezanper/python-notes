## REST Principles ##
#####################
- A rest api is a way of thinking about how a web server responds to your request
- It does not respond with just data, it responds with resources
- Resources are similar to object-oriented programming
- Think of the server as having resources, and each is able to interact with the pertinent request
- key feature is that REST is supposed to be stateless, this means one request cannot depend on any other requests
- The server only knows about the current request, and not any previous requests
- The application must send enough data to identify the user in every request, or else the server won't associate the request with the user
